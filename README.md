# Python Template

This is a personal template that I like to use for Python packages.

There aren't many customizable options because my needs are satisfied, but you're free to use and modify according to what you need.

## Usage

First, you'll need to install [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/README.html).

Then I invite you to run the following command:

``` bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/Kludex/python-template
```

Answer some questions, and TADA! :tada:

You have your Python package, ready to code! ðŸ™‚
